       "\n",
       "The article details the development and evolution of tariffs in the United States from its independence in 1776 through the post-World War II era. Key points include:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Initial Framework**: The federal government's ability to impose tariffs began with the Constitution in 1789, leading to the Tariff Act of 1789, which introduced a 5% tariff on imports. The U.S. Revenue Cutter Service was established to enforce these tariffs.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Protectionism Advocacy**: Alexander Hamilton and other economists argued for protective tariffs to develop U.S. manufacturing industries, marking the U.S. as a significant advocate of protectionism compared to Britain's free trade principles.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Infant Industry Argument**: Hamilton introduced the concept of \"infant industries,\" advocating temporary protection against foreign competition to allow these industries to grow.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Significant Tariff Changes**: The article chronicles how tariff rates increased during wartime, such as the War of 1812 and the Civil War, as well as political movements that shaped tariff policy, like the American System promoted by Henry Clay.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Lifelong Use of Tariffs**: U.S. tariffs remained high from the 19th century into the early 20th century, with periods of significant protectionist measures influencing industrial growth and national economic performance.\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Post-War Liberalization**: After World War II, the U.S. began to liberalize its trade policies, marking a shift from previous high tariff strategies.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, the U.S. experience with tariffs is portrayed as fundamental to its industrial independence and economic growth throughout its early history. The article suggests that protectionist policies directly contributed to the nation's rapid industrial development up until the mid-20th century."
